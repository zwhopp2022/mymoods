I'm Zachary Hopp, a Software Engineering major with an interest in mobile app development!
I've had some industry experience in the past which has spearheaded my motivation in all of my work/studies.
I look forwad to future challenges so that I can ever develop my skills towards being the best Engineer I possibly can be.
