I am Rainier Paguio, a computer science student currently in Drexel University.
I've always had an interest when it came to computers and technology which led me to choosing the major I am in right now.
I am looking forward to more experiences regarding coding, whether it be for a mobile app or a game, I will openly accept these challenges.
